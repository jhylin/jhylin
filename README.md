A brief background introduction can be accessed [here](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/about.html) via my [blog](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/), which showcases several different cheminformatics, machine learning and data science projects using various software toolkits. The main project I've been working on lately is the tree series in machine learning (with repositories shown in the pinned section below). There are also several other side projects that I've worked over the past year such as:

* [Working with scaffolds in small molecules](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/14_Scaffolds_in_small_molecules/chembl_anti-inf_data_prep_current.html) - Manipulating SMILES strings

* [Molecular visualisation (Molviz) web application](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/15_Molviz/Molviz.html) - Using Shiny for Python web application framework ([interactive data table part](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/15_Molviz/itables.html))

* [Small molecules in ChEMBL database - Series 1.1](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/08_ML1-1_Small_molecules_in_ChEMBL_database/ML1-1_chembl_cpds.html) - Polars dataframe library and machine learning in scikit-learn
  
* [Small molecules in ChEMBL database - series 1.2](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/10_ML1-2_Small_molecules_in_ChEMBL_database/ML1-2_chembl_cpds.html) - Cross-validation & hyper-parameter tuning with scikit-learn

* [Small molecules in ChEMBL database - series 1.3](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/11_ML1-3_Small_molecules_in_ChEMBL_database/ML1-3_chembl_cpds.html) - Re-training & re-evaluation with scikit-learn
