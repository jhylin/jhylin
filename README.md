My brief background introduction can be accessed [here](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/about.html) via my [blog](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/), which showcases several different cheminformatics, machine learning and data science projects using various software toolkits. The main project I've been working on lately is the tree series in machine learning on ChEMBL-derived data. There are also several other side projects that I've worked on over the past year such as:

* [Working with scaffolds in small molecules](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/14_Scaffolds_in_small_molecules/chembl_anti-inf_data_prep_current.html) - Manipulating SMILES strings

* [Molecular visualisation (Molviz) web application](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/15_Molviz/Molviz.html) - Using Shiny for Python web application framework ([interactive data table part](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/15_Molviz/itables.html))

* [Shinylive app in Python](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/13_Shiny_app_python/ShinyAppPy_PC_Cov19_app_embed_pyodide_http.html) - Embedding app in Quarto document (app embedded in web page) & using pyodide.http to import csv files

* [Small molecules in ChEMBL database - Polars dataframe library and machine learning in scikit-learn, series 1.1](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/08_ML1-1_Small_molecules_in_ChEMBL_database/ML1-1_chembl_cpds.html), [series 1.2 - Cross-validation & hyper-parameter tuning with scikit-learn](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/10_ML1-2_Small_molecules_in_ChEMBL_database/ML1-2_chembl_cpds.html) and [series 1.3 - Re-training & re-evaluation with scikit-learn](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/11_ML1-3_Small_molecules_in_ChEMBL_database/ML1-3_chembl_cpds.html)
